# data-product
A data product is the production output from a statistical analysis. Data products automate complex analysis tasks or use technology to expand the utility of a data informed model, algorithm or inference. This course covers the basics of creating data products using Shiny, R packages, and interactive graphics. This course focuses on the statistical fundamentals of creating a data product that can be used to tell a story about data to a mass audience.

You will learn how communicate using statistics and statistical products. Emphasis will be paid to communicating uncertainty in statistical results. You will learn how to create simple Shiny web applications and R packages for their data products. In addition, we'll cover reproducible presentations and interactive graphics.

Thanks!
